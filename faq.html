                <h3>Why on earth would anyone move to Mars?</h3>
                <p>
                    The short answer is. Because we can. Why did Columbus travel
                    west? Why did Marco Polo head east? Because it is that pull,
                    that unknown, that prospect of adventure that compels humans
                    to seek new frontiers to explore.<br /><br />

                    Sending a manned mission to Mars is a fantastic adventure.
                    Imagine living on another planet, millions of miles from the
                    Earth; looking up into the sky with the knowledge that one
                    of the 'stars' is actually the planet you were born on. Who
                    can even envision the incredible feeling of being the first
                    human in history to step out of the capsule and leave your
                    footprint on the surface of Mars? By this we implore you to
                    not just think of that feeling for the astronaut, but the
                    experience for all those watching back home. Those who
                    observed Neil Armstrong land on the Moon all those years ago
                    still remember every detail â€“ where they were, who they were
                    with and how they felt. The moment the first astronauts land
                    on Mars will be our moment to remember.<br /><br />

                    A second reason is good, old-fashioned curiosity. Where did
                    Mars come from? Can it teach us about Earth's history? Is
                    there life on Mars? These are just three of the hundreds of
                    burning questions for scientists all over the world.

                        Is this trip risky?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="faq__section1__grid-item2__article__text1">
                        The trip to Mars cannot be called risk free. Like any
                        venture in any means of travel, there are always things
                        that could go wrong. In the case of Mars One, the
                        following risks are conceivable:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accident(s) during launch</li>
                        <li>Vital components could malfunction</li>
                        <li>There could be problems when landing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="faq__section1__grid-item2__article__text2">
                        Although traveling to Mars will evidently bring risks,
                        if you were to compare our mission to the first Moon
                        mission in 1969, it quickly becomes apparent that this
                        mission is much safer.

                        During the working hours, the astronauts will be busy
                        performing three main tasks: construction, maintenance
                        and research. Besides work, they will also have time to
                        relax.

                    How long does it take to travel to Mars?
                </h3>
                <p class="faq__section2__article__text">
                    The trip takes around seven months; a bit longer than
                    astronauts currently stay on the International Space
                    Station.<br /><br />

                    The precise duration of each journey depends on when it is
                    taken. Because both Mars and Earth's orbits are not
                    perfectly circular, the time it takes to travel between them
                    varies from six to eight months.<br /><br />

                    When determining the course to Mars, the maximum travel time
                    for the astronauts is very important.
